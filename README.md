# About Me
### Hi! I'm CriticalProcessDied.
I’m a German programmer who started my coding journey in late 2022. My journey began with C++, and it remains my most-used language to this day. I’ve also grown to like C#, especially working on my project "Thorium" (check it out: discord.gg/fN7Vhy2zFT), which I built entirely with C#.

In addition to development, I’m passionate about malware analysis and computing. I enjoy creating malware or cracking crackmes (aswell as creating Anti-Debugging programs) for educational purposes, as it helps me better understand the complexities of cybersecurity and software systems. My main goal is to learn, explore, and contribute to the community.

If you wan't you can add me on discord if you have any questions or anything: CriticalProcessDied#0

Fun Fact: I got my name from messing around with system files and then got the BSOD Code CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED and decided to turn that into my username.
